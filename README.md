# SecureVault – DSA-Based Smart Password Manager

SecureVault is a **smart, local password manager** written in C++ that combines **DSA concepts** with **real-world security features** like password strength analysis, breach detection using a trie, and password reuse detection. It supports persistent storage through CSV files.
